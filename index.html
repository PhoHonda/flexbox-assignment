	<h2>Big idea</h2>
	<p>The idea about this lesson is to not lose your work when your stuff breaks or get stolen. So we can save it on our git forever if we don't delet it.
	The three states of git is modified where we do something to a file where we add a new line of code and then we type git status it would appear as modified. The other states is staged where the current file and the description for a commit. The last state is the staged is commit where the file is saved and safley cleaned. I understand it and im a 4.</p>
